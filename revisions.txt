Changes in version 1.1.0
------------------------

 BUG     BUG    BUG
INTRO | FIXED | DESCRIPTION

1.0.0   1.1.0   Stats & RTD reports can cause crash when no (-r out) specified with a steps column
1.0.0   1.1.0   RTDs with search steps > 2^31 weren't sorted properly: (un)signed int issue
1.0.0   1.1.0   The RTD report could be incorrect if non -cutoff termination is used (-timeout, -noimprove) and <100% success
1.0.0   1.1.0   Wrong heuristic trigger for weighted adaptive nov+ [-alg adaptnovelty+ -w]
1.0.0   1.1.0   Score miscalculation in [-alg novelty(+) -w] and [-alg walksat-tabu -w]
1.0.0   1.1.0   Std. Deviation statistic miscalculation for row stats (not col. stats)
1.0.0   1.1.0   Some stats (example: VarFlipCounts) would only count from last restart
