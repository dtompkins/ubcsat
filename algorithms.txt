To the best of our knowledge all algorithms in UBCSAT behave identically to their orginal implementation.  While the exact results may differ (because of different random search trajectories, etc.) over several runs the run-length distributions generated by UBCSAT are equivalent to those produced by the original algorithms.

For most algorithms the UBCSAT implementation is faster (or just as fast) as the original implementation.  In the few circumstances where UBCSAT is slower the difference is usually due to UBCSAT reporting overhead and can be eliminated by turning off reports (use parameters: -r out null -r stats null).

= Adaptive G2WSAT
> [LiWeiZha07]
* Uses Novelty+ as the WalkSAT algorithm and selects the oldest (not best) decreasing promising variable.
* {g2wsat}

= Adaptive G2WSAT+p
> [LiWeiZha07]
* Uses Novelty+p as the WalkSAT algorithm.
* {g2wsat}

= Adaptive Novelty+
> [Hoos02]
- -alg adaptnovelty+
* There was an typo in the paper for updating wp: It should be wp := wp - wp * phi / 2.  The results in the paper, the original implementation and the UBCSAT implementation are all based on this corrected value.
* In the paper, the noise being adapted is the novelty noise (-novnoise in the novelty algorithm), not the random walk parameter (-wp) which is set to 0.01 by default in Adaptive Novelty+.
* {adaptnoise}
- -alg adaptnovelty+ -v params
* This variant has 2 parameters (phi,theta) that allow you to adjust the algorithm's adaptivity.
- -alg adaptnovelty+ -w
* {weighted+wcs}

= Conflict-Directed Random Walk
> [Papadimitriou91]
- -alg crwalk
* Also known as Papadimitriou's algorithm.
- -alg crwalk -v schoening
> [Schoening99]
* Also known as Schöning's Algorithm.
* Is Papadimitriou's algorithm with a restart every 3n steps.

* {weighted+wcs}
- -alg crwalk -v schoening -w
* {weighted+wcs}

= DDFW: Divide and Distribute Fixed Weights
> [IshEtAl05]
- -alg ddfw
* The original implementation from the authors has a parameter (-tl) that was not mentioned in the original paper: with probability (1-tl) a random neighbour (in lieu of the neighbour with maximum penalty) is selected to distribute weight from.  The UBCSAT implementation includes this parameter with a default setting of (0.99).

- -alg samd
* very similar to GSAT-TABU, except the age of flipped variables are not changed (and hence not tabu) if they were flipped in an improving search step.
- -alg samd -w
* {weighted}

= SAPS: Scaling and Probabilistic Smoothing
> [HutTomHoo02]
- -alg saps
* The paper describes the clause weight update procedure to be: w_i := w_i * rho + (1 - rho) * w_avg, but in practice the first term (w_i * rho) is a scalar change that can be ignored.  However, this also means that setting rho = 0 may not achieve the desired effect.
* As a result the former change in the clause updates, clause weights can grow to be arbitrarily large and so UBCSAT (as did the original SAPS implementation) performs a re-normalization: whenever a clause weight exceeds the value of 1000, all clause weights are divided by 1000.
* The UBCSAT implementation has an additional parameter of a threshold (-sapsthresh) that is used to determine how much an improvement is considered to be an improvement.  The default parameter of (-0.1) is consistent with the value used in the original SAPS implementation.  This threshold was not mentioned in the paper.

* {wp}

= VW2: Variable Weighting Scheme Two
> [Prestwich05]
* {wp}
* Variable Weights are implemented in UBCSAT with (double) floating point precision.
* In author's original source code, it exits on the first freebie variable it discovers, whereas in UBCSAT it uniformly randomly selects amongst all freebies randomly (as described in the paper) -- This is a very minor discrepency.

{academic} This algorithm was developed for acadameic interest, and is not recommended for practical applications.
{adaptnoise} The UBCSAT implementation uses a higher precision to store the adaptive noise parameter, which may cause slight algorithmic variations on longer runs.
{g2wsat} See the G2WSAT entry for additional implementation details.
{maxflips} The MAX-TRIES and MAX-FLIPS parameters correspond to UBCSAT parameters (-srestart MAX-FLIPS -cutoff MAX-TRIES * MAX-FLIPS).  See the online UBCSAT FAQ for more details.
{novnoise} The algorithm noise parameter p as described in the paper is implemented in UBCSAT as (-novnoise).
{preproc} The original algorithm software implementation performed some pre-processing, whereas UBCSAT does not.  See the online UBCSAT FAQ for more details.
{preproc1} The pre-processing was: duplicate literal elimination, pure literal elimination, true clause elimination and unit propagation.
{saps} See the SAPS entry for additional implementation details.
{weighted} This is a weighted variant that incorporates clause weights into the heuristic (i.e.: for Weighted MAX-SAT).
{weighted+wcs} This is a weighted variant that incorporates clause weights into the heuristic (i.e.: for Weighted MAX-SAT) including a weighted clause selection scheme.
{wp} The algorithm noise parameter p as described in the paper is implemented in UBCSAT as (-wp).
